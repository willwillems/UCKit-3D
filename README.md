# UCKit-3D
Arduino code for the upcycle kit for the A&amp;H Xone 3D. Can be run on the UCKit hardware itself or on any Atmega32u4 based Arduino (Leonardo, Pro Micro, Micro). Emulates the digital mechanisms of the Xone 3D and can be extended to function as a class compliant MIDI device.

Happy hacking.
